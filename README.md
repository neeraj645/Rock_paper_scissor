# Rock_paper_scissor
This is a **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implemented in Python. The program allows the user to play against the computer in an interactive loop. 

- The user selects a choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by entering `1`, `2`, or `3`. 
- The computer randomly picks its choice.
- A comparison is made to determine the winner based on the game's rules:
  - Rock beats scissors.
  - Scissors beat paper.
  - Paper beats rock.
  - Identical choices result in a draw.
  
The game provides real-time feedback on the outcome (win, lose, or draw). The user can quit at any time by entering `4`. 

The code is designed for simplicity, readability, and modularity, with dedicated functions for mapping choices, determining the winner, and handling user input.
